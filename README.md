# ECE 4340- Building Intelligent (Vision-Guided) Robots

This repo showcases two different types of vision-based guidance: one for a stationary robot arm with a stereo camera setup and one for a mobile robot with a single camera.

The stationary robot files are primarily in `lab01/` and `lab05/`, and encompass MATLAB based image detection, as well as commands to transform camera frames to a Puma robot arm and move the latter accordingly.

The mobile robotics files are mostly located in the `catkin_ws/src/` directory, and feature primarily python and ROS code to navigate a Create 2 robot using various methods of feedback and obstacle avoidance.
